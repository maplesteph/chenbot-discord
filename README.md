# chenbot-discord
chenbot, for discord

spiritual successor to her IRC version. rip

the reason its setup looks different from a lot of other simple discord bots i've seen is because it is able to load modules made for each server, each module tailored to let chen do what i want her to do within that server. it doesn't do anything in particular, it's just a shitposting bot.

## TODO:
* turn servers into classes and make it so that stuff doesnt make a new class of feature module each time
